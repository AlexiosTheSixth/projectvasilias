My latest strategy RPG sandbox game, the name is temporary until I can decide on a better one later in development.

To be upfront: I plan to be MIT license and FOSS for the early alpha stages then later on in development go commercial while still keeping the then "classic" version MIT license and FOSS free for people to do whatever with. This is because I don't really wanna sell people a low-quality early access that might not even go anywhere, I wanna wait until the game is at least in beta before putting it on Steam and GoG.
